# A simple neral network for classification using tensorflow mid-level API.
Its a very simple neural network with two hidden layers. The advantage of using mid level API is that it gives the flexibility to modify layers and at the same time, avoids the complication of defining each layers (weights, biases etc.) manually.
## Data set 
MNIST data set has been used.

## Requirements

* Tensorflow >= 1.6
* Numpy
* sklearn
